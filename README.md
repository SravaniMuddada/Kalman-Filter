# Kalman Filter for Object Tracking (Navigation)

## Project Overview
This project involves designing a Kalman filter for object tracking using MATLAB. The Kalman filter is a set of mathematical equations that provides an efficient computational (recursive) solution for the least-squares method, supporting estimations of past, present, and future states even when the precise nature of the modeled system is unknown. This project includes multiple examples to illustrate the implementation of Kalman filters for tracking in different dimensions.

## Introduction
The Kalman filter, introduced by R.E. Kalman in 1960, addresses the problem of estimating the state of a discrete-time controlled process. It is powerful for its ability to provide estimations of past, present, and future states while handling unknown system dynamics. This project demonstrates
